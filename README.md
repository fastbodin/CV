Welcome to my formatted CV and accompanying personal statement (with the same formatting). This formatting was originally passed on to me by Sarah Mayes-Tang. I have since made some alterations. If you like my CV and would like to use a similar format, download cv.tex and res.cls (put them in the same directory) from the CV directory and get formatting. If you want to use the accompanying personal statement formatting, download it from the other folder. Good luck!
